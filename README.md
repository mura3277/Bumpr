# Car4Sale
Car4Sale is a online marketplace for used vehicles that allows sellers to compare their car to similar models based on price, mileage, the overall state of the car and other useful qualities. The service does not assume knowledge of the car market and aids in making the advertisement high quality and thus successful. Listing a car on the marketplace costs a small fee appropriate to the length of the advertising period.

## Vision
When developing the proof of concept software, we focused on the core features, namely ability to create car adverts and search through them. The current version allows a user to:

-Create an account
-Log in and log out of their account
-Have access to their user profile
-Post an advert (for now it includes writing title and description of the car)
-Update or delete the advert they created
-Display all adverts and search through them (both simple and advanced search)

All these features still need improvement. They are now the backbone and foundations for developing the website next term, which includes adding the graphic design, all front-end parts and new functionalities like the messaging system.
